# Ruby Design Patterns

Code examples as I code along with the book "Design Patterns in Ruby" by Russ Olsen.

The book covers 14 of the "Gang of Four" patterns from a Ruby point of view, as well as explaining what problems each of the patterns are intended to solve (in addition to some Ruby specific varitations). Additionally, the book looks at several new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community, including creating objects with metaprogramming and "Convention Over Configuration".

Inside each of the pattern examples, I have provided some short commented notes of what the pattern is intended to do, as well as when it should and should not be used.

Patterns covered in this repository include:

- Template Method
- Strategy
- Observer
- Composite
- Iterator
- Commands
- Adapter
- Proxy
- Decorator
- Singleton
- Factory
- Builder
- Interpreter
- Domain-Specific Languages
- Meta-programming
- Convention over configuration
